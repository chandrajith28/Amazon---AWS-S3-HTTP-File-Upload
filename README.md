# Amazon---AWS-S3-HTTP-File-Upload-DJANGO-PYTHON-backend
This repository consists of the modules that can be added to your python/django application to upload files into your AWS S3 bucket directly from a webpage
Instructions: This repository consists of two files:
1)django backend.py - this file consists of 3 functions/methods, copy these methods into your views.py file to implement the same in your django application
2)file_upload.html - webpage that will be used to upload file, add this to the templates folder of your app
There are certain values in the code that have been removed due to security reasons, you will have to enter your personal AWS S3 details in the place of these values. Also ensure that you have linked the django backend.py file with the file_upload.html file correctly.
